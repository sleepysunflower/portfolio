    <h1>üåç Flood Impact Prediction in the Mono River Basin</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Flooding remains one of the most destructive natural hazards in West Africa, with impacts expected to intensify under climate change. 
      This project explores retrospective flood risk analysis in the Mono River Basin using satellite-derived rainfall and terrain data. 
      By simulating runoff and water accumulation using a volume comparison method, this project identifies areas historically vulnerable to flooding 
      and evaluates how infrastructure and population may be affected.
    </p>
    <p class="callout">
      Although this analysis is based on historical rainfall, the workflow is designed as a foundation for future predictive tools. 
      With real-time rainfall input or climate projections, this method can be extended into an early warning or planning system.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Methods &amp; Tools Used</h2>
    <h3>üîß Tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>QGIS: spatial preprocessing, watershed delineation, map generation</li>
      <li>Python (Rasterio, NumPy): rainfall‚Äìrunoff simulation, volume comparison method</li>
      <li>Leaflet (planned): static web map for portfolio hosting</li>
      <li>Hugging Face / Gradio: attempted deployment for interactive prediction (later abandoned due to resource limits)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üåÄ Hydrological Modeling Workflow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Runoff Simulation:</strong> <em>Q = P √ó C</em><br />
        Monthly rainfall raster <em>P</em> multiplied by runoff coefficient raster <em>C</em> to get runoff depth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Volume Comparison Method:</strong><br />
        Estimate water volume per pixel; compare against terrain storage capacity derived from DEM. 
        Pixels where runoff exceeds terrain capacity are flagged as flooded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flood Mask Generation:</strong><br />
        Create binary raster masks for different rainfall scenarios; overlay with population and building layers to assess impact.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Results &amp; Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis, based on recent historical rainfall data, serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding flood vulnerability in the basin.
      However, the modular method can be adapted to accept real-time or projected rainfall values, making it a scalable prototype for flood forecasting
      or adaptation planning under climate scenarios.
    </p>

    <h3>üåä Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Urbanized and low-lying parts of the basin showed high vulnerability.</li>
      <li>Runoff accumulation increases rapidly past ~100&nbsp;mm rainfall in some sub-basins.</li>
      <li>Flood extent does not scale linearly with rainfall due to topographic thresholds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üìà Infrastructure Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Count of buildings affected by floodwaters per scenario.</li>
      <li>Map overlays show clustering of risk zones near dense settlements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üë• Population Impact</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Population raster clipped by flood masks.</li>
      <li>Estimations of people exposed to pluvial flood risk under different scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
